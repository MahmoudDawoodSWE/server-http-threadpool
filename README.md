# server-http-threadpool
An HTTP server thread pool is a mechanism used in server applications to handle incoming HTTP requests concurrently and efficiently.

Instead of creating a new thread for each incoming request, which can be resource-intensive and limit scalability, a thread pool is employed.

The thread pool consists of a fixed number of pre-created threads that are ready to process incoming requests.

When a request arrives, it is assigned to an available thread from the pool, which then handles the request. Once the request is processed, 
the thread becomes available again for handling another request.

Using a thread pool offers several benefits. First, it reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each request, 
resulting in improved performance and reduced latency. Second, it helps limit the number of concurrent threads,
preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring stability under high load. Lastly, it provides better control over system resources,
allowing the server to prioritize and manage incoming requests effectively.

Overall, an HTTP server thread pool allows for efficient and concurrent processing of incoming HTTP requests by reusing a fixed set of threads,
improving performance, scalability, and resource management in server applications.
